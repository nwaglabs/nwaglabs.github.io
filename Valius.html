        <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
        <div class="text-section-content">
            <p>Before diving into design, I conducted a thorough discovery phase to understand the market, the users, and the expectations surrounding business sales platforms. Valius set out to simplify the connection between buyers and sellers while offering expert guidance through over 50 in-depth articles. This dual-purpose platform needed to balance functionality with credibility. I reviewed competing directories, analysed user behaviours in similar transactional platforms, and worked closely with the Valius team to map out their core values and goals.</p>
            <p>The research revealed a gap in the market for a brand that felt both professional and human. Many competitors leaned heavily on outdated or overly corporate visuals that lacked personality. This insight guided early branding workshops and helped shape the foundation of the visual identity. We identified the need for a clean, modern interface that users could trust, paired with a logo that would leave a lasting impression without overwhelming the brand. These insights directly informed the art direction and set the tone for the entire platform design moving forward.</p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <div class="text-section-content">
            <p>Designing the Valius platform required a UX-first approach to cater to two distinct user groups: buyers searching for businesses and sellers listing them. The core challenge was creating a seamless, intuitive experience that made it easy for both parties to navigate listings, initiate communication, and engage with the platform confidently. Valius wanted a user journey that felt effortless—minimising friction at every touchpoint while maintaining a polished, professional interface.</p>
            <p>In addition to the marketplace functionality, the platform houses a substantial library of over 50 expert-written guides. Structuring and surfacing this content in a way that felt supportive rather than overwhelming was key. The challenge lay in ensuring these resources were easily discoverable and contextually relevant, offering guidance at critical moments in the user flow. The interface needed to strike the right balance between simplicity and depth—empowering users with tools and insights without overcomplicating their journey.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <div class="text-section-content">
            <p>To meet the dual needs of buyers and sellers, I developed a clean, modular interface that prioritised clarity, ease of use, and accessibility across devices. User flows were mapped out to reduce cognitive load and simplify key actions—such as browsing listings, making enquiries, and managing communications. The layout was deliberately structured to guide users naturally through the platform, ensuring that core features were always intuitive and within reach.</p>
            <p>The help guides were integrated thoughtfully within the experience rather than siloed away. By surfacing relevant articles at key decision points—such as during listing creation or when submitting an enquiry—I ensured users had access to expert support without disrupting their flow. UI components were kept consistent, minimal, and purposeful, allowing the content and functionality to take centre stage. Combined with a calming, professional visual language developed during the branding phase, the result was a seamless digital product that empowers users to engage confidently with the platform.</p>

        <h3>The Outcome</h3>
        <div class="text-section-content">
            <p>The final platform launch was met with strong positive feedback from both the Valius team and early users. Buyers praised the clarity of navigation and ease of engaging with sellers, while sellers found the listing process intuitive and efficient. The integration of contextual help guides significantly reduced support queries and helped build user confidence throughout the buying and selling journey.</p>
            <p>The cohesive brand identity and considered UI design established Valius as a trustworthy, modern presence in a traditionally outdated market. By blending functional simplicity with a distinctive visual style, the platform now stands out not only for what it offers—but how it offers it. Valius has laid a strong foundation for long-term growth, with a digital experience that scales alongside its expanding user base and content library.</p>
